# web-transport

[WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport_API) is a new browser API powered by [QUIC](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html) intended as a replacement for WebSockets.
Most importantly, QUIC supports multiple independent data streams.

This crate provides a generic WebTransport implementation depending on the platform:

-   Native: [web-transport-quinn](../web-transport-quinn)
-   WASM: [web-transport-wasm](../web-transport-wasm)

## Why no trait?

[I did make a generic trait](https://docs.rs/webtransport-generic/latest/webtransport_generic/). However, async traits are quite problematic and difficult to use.
It shortly became impossible when trying to add WASM support because of `!Send`.

So this crate switches the implementation based on the underlying platform.
As an added benefit, you no longer need to litter your code with
generics. I got pretty fed up constantly writing `moq_transport<S: web_transport_generic::Session>`.
